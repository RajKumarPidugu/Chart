# Chart
Candidate Test Documentation:
User Story:
As a developer, I want to test and document my code for fetching and displaying data using Chart.js, ensuring it performs optimally and meets all requirements.

Task 1: Implement and Test ‘fetchBarData’ function
Process: 
Worked on JavaScript code. Mainly used the ‘fetch()’ API to retrieve data from the specified URL. 
Handled Potential errors which occurred during the fetch operation and logged them to the command prompt for debugging.
Example:
Implemented the ‘fetchBarData’ function, ensures the accurate retrieval and processes all the data from the API.
Testing:
Validated the functions by checking cmd logs for fetched data and error messages while checking errors with the API.

Task 2: Implement and Test ‘createBarChart’ function
Process:
Developed a JavaScript code which mainly used Chart.js. To create a bar chart based on the data fetched in Task 1, created it. 
Verified the chart renders properly on the web page and handled scenarios where the canvas element is missing.
Example:
Implemented the ‘createBarChart’ function to initialize Chart.js with data and options.
Properly ensured the displays in the chart on a designated canvas element.
Testing:
Verified the functionality by viewing the web page and confirmed that the chart appears as expected.
Checked for any JavaScript errors in the browser console.

Task 3: Optimize JavaScript and CSS
Process:
Improved the performance of JavaScript and CSS files by minimizing their size through techniques like compression.
Example:
Used automated tools to minify and compress JavaScript and CSS files.
Reduced their download times and enhanced overall application speed.


Testing:
Tested optimized files in the browser to maintain the functionality while providing performance metrics in network and loading times.

Task 4: Monitor Performance and Refine
Process:
Continuously monitored application performance using browser developer tools.
Analyzed metrics which are related to network requests, JavaScript execution and rendering times.
Example:
Used Chrome DevTools to profile JavaScript performance, monitored network requests and evaluated page load times. 
Made some adjustments to the code and checked configurations based on the performance data.
Testing:
Implemented refinements based on the performance insights and tested again for the application behavior.
Document findings and adjustments during the optimization process.
